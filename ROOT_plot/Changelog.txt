## Added

- Implemented signal bus for custom UI signals, along with an update signal 
  that is run every few UI update frames and connected to histogram plotting.
- Restored full ADC and TDC histogram plotting to the GUI version of the
  monitor.
- Added a window that opens on run start. Plotting windows can be opened and
  close from this window. Plotting windows should now exit nicely, without
  producing segfaults.

## Changed

- DAQData is now passed into the monitor from the decode thread for better
  organization.
- DAQData is reset at the start of the decode thread instead of the monitor
  thread.
- PCapSessionHandler now buffers all available packets at once with a call to
  pcap_dispatch with negative second argument, rather than buffering them one
  at a time. Packet counting has been updated for the new implementation.
- UI loop now makes some naive attempts to maintain a consistent frame rate.

## Fixed

- DeviceSelectorPanel::setDeviceName() would attempt a null dereference if 
  passed the name of a device that does not exist.
- Deleting various views would induce double deletion due to erroneous explicit
  calls to superclass destructors.

## Known Issues

- Occasional segfaults occur when opening and closing windows.
